# Rules of Number Scrabble

1. Two players alternate turns, picking an available number between 1 .. 9 (inclusive).

2. Players cannot choose a number that has already been chosen by either player.

3. The first player to collect three numbers that sum to 15 wins! \
   If a player has four or five numbers, any set of three counts.
