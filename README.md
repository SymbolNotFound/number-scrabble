## Tutorial Included

This game is very simple, it may look like one you're familiar with.

I don't expect it to be fun -- I made it as a vehicle for a tutorial about setting up VitePress and putting together a basic Vue3 site.  I made it for a few specific people but if you also find it useful, great!
